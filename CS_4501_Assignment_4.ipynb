I picked three hidden layers because it made sense that one hidden layer would attempt to pick up lines, the next layer would attempt to put those lines together into shapes (i.e. squares, circles, rectangles, etc.), and the third layer would put those shapes together to form more complicated shapes.\n",

I funneled those 515 neurons into 350 other categories of shapes around (~2/3 of 515), and then I figured there would be multiple variations of a single item (therefore placing the number of neurons in the last level at 225, or ~2/3 of 350).
